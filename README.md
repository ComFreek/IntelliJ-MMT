# IntelliJ-MMT
An IntelliJ-Plugin for MMT (under development)

## Installation
- The latest version of this plugin can be installed from *IntelliJ's marketplace* (File -> Settings -> Plugins)
- Alternatively, you can install the plugin by extracting `build/distributions/MMT-<version>.zip` into the `plugins`-folder of your IntelliJ-installation (which might be something like `/usr/share/idea/plugins` or `/opt/share/intellij-idea-ultimate-edition`)

## Usage
- Set up a new MathHub-project in IntelliJ (this will contain all your MMT archives, a .msl-file and an mmtrc). You may choose a preexisting folder with MMT archives; these will **not** be overwritten.
- In the project-view on the left, select the *MathHub* view to get an overview over all available MMT archives on 
[MathHub](http://gl.mathhub.info). You can *git clone* them via right-clicking an archive and choosing *Install archive*.
- By default, the Plugin does **not** type check the terms of an open *mmt*-file, since doing so is computationally expensive and inconvenvient for the user. Type checking can be easily activated and deactivated in the *Errors* panel of the MMT tool window (View -> Tool Windows -> MMT)
- The *Document Tree* (on the left border of the IntelliJ-Window) only shows the syntax tree of the document that has been type checked last. To see the tree for the currently opened document, check the *Type Checking* checkbox in the *Errors* panel. Automatically navigating the syntax tree by caret position in the document can be turned on and off with the corresponding check box at the top of the *Document Tree* panel.
