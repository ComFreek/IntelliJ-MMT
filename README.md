# IntelliJ-MMT
An IntelliJ-Plugin for MMT (under development)

## Usage
- Install the plugin by extracting `bundled.zip` into the `plugins`-folder of your IntelliJ-installation (which
might be something like `/usr/share/idea/plugins` or `/opt/share/intellij-idea-ultimate-edition`)
- Set up a new MathHub-project in IntelliJ (this will contain all your MMT archives, a .msl-file and an mmtrc)
- In the project-view on the left, select the MathHub view to get an overview over all available MMT archive on 
MathHub. You can git clone them via right-clicking an archive.
